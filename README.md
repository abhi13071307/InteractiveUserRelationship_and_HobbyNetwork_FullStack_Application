#Interactive User Relationship & Hobby Network

#Project Description

The Interactive Friendship Network MERN App is a full-stack web application that enables users to create profiles, manage hobbies, and form friendships all visualized dynamically through an interactive graph powered by React Flow.

Users can:
- Create, update, and delete user profiles with details such as name, age, and hobbies.
- Add hobbies that reflect shared interests.
- Link and unlink friendships between users.
- View all users and their connections through a graph visualization.
- Track dynamic popularity scores that update automatically based on friendships and shared hobbies.
- See real-time visual changes in the graph where node size and color intensity reflect user popularity.

Built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with TypeScript, this project provides an engaging and data-driven interface to understand user relationships and shared interests.

-Each created user appears as a node on the graph.

#2. Manage Hobbies

-Use the Sidebar to browse or add new hobbies.
-Drag and drop hobbies from the sidebar onto a user node to assign them.
-Users sharing hobbies become more connected through their popularity score.

#3. Build Friendships

-Connect two nodes directly on the graph to create a friendship.
-Use the Unlink option in the user panel to remove friendships.
-The graph refreshes dynamically after every action.

#4. Visualize Popularity

-Node size and color intensity change according to each user‚Äôs popularity.
-Popularity Score Formula: Popularity = (Number of unique friends) + (Number of shared hobbies √ó 0.5)
-Any update to hobbies or relationships instantly reflects on the graph.
